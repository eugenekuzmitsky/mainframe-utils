# mainframe-utils
Utilities for handling some mainframe operations on local machine.

First one is ftp-backup. I needed to backup my datasets from different mainframes and put them into local git.  Since zOSMF is not available for these installations I can't use zowe-cli for backup automation. So I used command line ftp client on Linux to do it. Should work on mac also, though wasn't tested yet.
